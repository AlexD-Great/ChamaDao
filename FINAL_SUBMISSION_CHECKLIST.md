## 🎥 Demo Video Script Template

```
[INTRO - 30 seconds]
Hi! I'm [Name], and I'm excited to present ChamaDAO for the ETH Safari 2025 Hackathon.

ChamaDAO brings traditional African community savings groups to the blockchain, solving a $1 billion problem with transparency, security, and democratic governance.

[PROBLEM - 1 minute]
In Africa, over 60% of the population is unbanked, but millions participate in informal savings groups called "Chamas." 

The problem? These groups lack transparency, face high fraud risks, and have no verifiable records. That's over $1 billion locked in systems vulnerable to mismanagement.

[SOLUTION - 1 minute]
ChamaDAO solves this by putting Chamas on the blockchain. Our smart contract automates contributions, enables democratic voting on loans, and provides complete transparency.

Every transaction is recorded on-chain, eliminating fraud and building trust.

[DEMO - 2-3 minutes]
Let me show you the live application at chama-dao-nextjs.vercel.app.

[Navigate through pages]
- Here's our landing page with an African-inspired design
- Users can create a new Chama with custom contribution amounts
- The Explore page shows all available Chamas
- The dashboard displays your personal Chamas and stats
- Each Chama has a detail page for managing contributions and loans

[Show Etherscan]
Our smart contract is live on Sepolia testnet, fully verified and ready to use.

[TECH - 1 minute]
Built with Next.js 15, Solidity, RainbowKit, and Wagmi. The frontend is deployed on Vercel, and the contract is on Sepolia.

[IMPACT - 30 seconds]
ChamaDAO has the potential to serve millions of Africans, providing financial inclusion through blockchain technology. It's scalable, secure, and ready for real-world adoption.

Thank you for watching! Check out our GitHub and live demo.
